 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Ayman's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding adventure started back when I just applied for college, trying to find my way through the maze of career options out there. I knew I had to pick a path, and I've always been drawn to things that involve building and keeping things safe. That's how I stumbled into computer science, and more specifically, cybersecurity. It just felt right, so I decided to dive in.
  My first coding class was a game-changer. I absolutely loved it and knew I'd found my thing. Now, I'm all about moving forward and soaking up as much knowledge as I can in this field. There's also this dream I have – starting my own company that focuses on protecting people online. Sure, there are plenty of security services out there, but I believe I've got something different to offer. I'm really looking forward to making that dream a reality pretty soon.
